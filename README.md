# Laravel / Inertiajs / Vuejs Demo for Liquid Freight

This is a very basic proof-of-concept, please lower your expectations before cloning.  The site requires PHP 8

## GETTING STARTED
- Clone this repo to your local dev environment
- You can start with any Liquid Freight database dump that includes DTT database updates
- Configure the database information in the .env file (see .env.example) 
- From the command line in the app directory, run `php artisan migrate` to create the tables required for this app
- Run `composer install` and `npm install`
- Run `npm run watch` before you start playing with the app
- Register yourself as a user (while you need to log in to access the liquid freight page, the site is hard-coded to use a liquid-freight-linked user when generating content)
- There is only one page right now, and you can only view data...more to come

It is entirely possible that I missed some steps.  Let Chris know if you have issues.
